This is a criminal identification system which can find any criminal at a moment.  It basically a flying detector which works with a drone. Which can detect any unusual object from its emitted wave and rays. In part of this project is to identify any unusual wave and signal which is emitted from criminal weapons and various exclusives etc. when a man or a criminal carry likes some weapons like guns, booms etc. and enter our restricted area which is covered a ruder system then we can get a signal of his existence from our ruder. then we send our flying detector to him to scan him and to detect which kind of weapons he has by his weapon's emitted a wave and rays. Then if the flying detector find and unusual object with him then it will connect to the main control office to come and catch him. At the same time our flying detector will continuously follow the criminal and send the existence of criminal to the control office.
